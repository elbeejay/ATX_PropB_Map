# Miscellaneous GIS Information

There are several commented out lines in [shaded_map_for_vote.sh](../shaded_map_for_vote.sh) which use GIS files not provided in this repository. These are lake and river features, road centerlines, and railroads.

These GIS shapefiles can be obtained from the [City of Austin Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/), and if placed in this sub-directory will work with the GMT script file without any additional modifications. 

In the output map shown on the main repository page, the water features and railroads are included in the visual.
